		  steadily increasing over the past several years. One of the
		  most prominent among these is the survey research
		  methodology which has often been used to capture data from
		  business organizations. However, to effectively contribute
		  to theory development in the POM field, this methodology
		  must be carefully implemented. Poorly designed and executed
		  survey research is of little or no value. This paper
		  attempts to provide a normative perspective on `good survey
		  research practices'. In doing so, it attempts to bridge the
		  gap between survey research and theory development. The
		  paper liberally draws from work in other social science
		  disciplines like psychology, marketing, organizational
		  behavior, and other related fields that are more mature in
		  the use of surveys, and applies it to the POM area. A set
		  of ideal survey research attributes are identified, and
		  existing POM survey work in four prestigious academic
		  journals is evaluated with respect to these attributes.
		  Results of assessing 25 survey-based articles published in
		  these journals between 1990 and 1995 indicate that both

		  conducted, with current emphasis being more on explanatory
		  kind of research. In order to move the field forward,

		  and purifying them through field-based pretesting. More
		  sophisticated POM studies in the future would have to aim
		  for testing theory with reliable and valid scales that are
		  relatively free of measurement related errors. It is hoped
		  that this work will act as a catalyst in compressing the
